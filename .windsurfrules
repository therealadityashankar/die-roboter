1. In the newer version of @headlessui/react, we should use TabGroup, TabPanels, TabList, TabPanel directly instead of Tab.Group, Tab.Panels, Tab.List, Tab.Panel, please ensure that this is followed
2. When I am referring to turning a functional react component into a class, i typically mean that there is a base class â€“ which itself isn't a react component, but it has a class function that returns a functional react component. 
    so for example something like

    ```ts
    class RobotConnection {
        constructor() {
            ...
        }
        
        render(): React.FC {
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>Robot Connection</p>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Imo this has an advantage of removing callback functions and making code a little bit cleaner

3. Avoid try catch blocks
