# SO101 Robot Documentation

## Overview

The SO101 is the first robot implementation in the Die Roboter series. It's a 6-axis robotic arm with a gripper, designed for simulation in Three.js environments. The robot is loaded from a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file and provides an intuitive interface for controlling its joints through a pivot mapping system.

## Technical Specifications

- **Type**: 6-axis robotic arm with gripper
- **URDF Source**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/therealadityashankar/die-roboter/urdf/so101.urdf`
- **Control Interface**: Pivot mapping system with normalized ranges (-100 to 100)
- **Rendering Engine**: Three.js

## Joint Configuration

The SO101 robot has the following joints:

| Pivot Name     | Joint Name   | Description                                   | Range        |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| shoulder_pan   | Rotation     | Base rotation (swivel)                        | -100 to 100  |
| shoulder_lift  | Pitch        | Shoulder joint (up/down movement)             | -100 to 100  |
| elbow_flex     | Elbow        | Elbow joint (bend/extend)                     | -100 to 100  |
| wrist_flex     | Wrist_Pitch  | Wrist pitch (up/down movement)                | -100 to 100  |
| wrist_roll     | Wrist_Roll   | Wrist rotation                                | -100 to 100  |
| gripper        | Jaw          | Gripper (open/close)                          | -100 to 100  |

## Pivot Mapping System

The SO101 uses a pivot mapping system that separates the user-facing control ranges from the actual joint limits in the URDF model:

1. **User Control Range**: All joints use a normalized range of -100 to 100 for consistent and intuitive control
2. **Joint Limits**: The actual physical limits of each joint as defined in the URDF model (typically in radians)
3. **Mapping**: Values from the user control range are automatically mapped to the corresponding joint limits

This system allows for:
- Consistent UI controls regardless of the underlying joint limits
- Protection against exceeding physical joint limits
- Automatic adaptation to different robot models with varying joint configurations

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { SO101 } from 'die-roboter';
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create scene and add robot
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const robot = new SO101();
scene.add(robot);

// Load the robot model (returns a promise)
await robot.loadModel();

// Control individual joints
robot.setPivotValue('shoulder_pan', 50);  // Set to 50% of max rotation

// Control multiple joints at once
robot.setPivotValues({
  'shoulder_lift': 30,
  'elbow_flex': -20,
  'wrist_flex': 10,
  'wrist_roll': 45,
  'gripper': -80  // Close gripper
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Accessing Joint Information

You can access the underlying joint information directly:

```javascript
// Get all joints
const joints = robot.joints;

// Get all pivots with their current values and ranges
const pivots = robot.pivots;

// Get current value of a specific pivot
const shoulderPanValue = robot.pivots['shoulder_pan'].value;
```

### Error Handling

The SO101 robot includes built-in error handling:

- Warns when joint limits are missing in the URDF (uses default values of Â±3.14 radians)
- Warns when a joint specified in the pivot map is not found in the URDF
- Returns false when attempting to set a non-existent pivot

## Implementation Details

The SO101 class extends the base Robot class and initializes with a predefined unmapped pivot map that specifies:
- The name of each pivot for UI reference
- The corresponding joint name in the URDF model
- The user-friendly control range (-100 to 100)

During model loading, the robot automatically:
1. Loads the URDF model
2. Scales it appropriately for Three.js rendering
3. Updates the mapped joint limits based on the URDF specifications
4. Provides warnings for any configuration issues

## Best Practices

- Always await the `loadModel()` method before attempting to control the robot
- Use the pivot mapping system rather than directly controlling joints
- Handle the case where a joint might not be found in the URDF
- Consider the physical limitations of the robot when planning movements
